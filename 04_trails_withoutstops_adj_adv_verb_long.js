Most computer magazines offer ( or offered ) advice , some offer programming tutorials , reviews of the latest technologies , and advertisements . 1980s computer magazines skewed their content towards the hobbyist end of the then microcomputer market , and used to contain type-in program s , but these have gone out of fashion .

Most computer magazines offer ( or offered ) advice , some offer programming tutorials , reviews of the latest technologies , and advertisements . 1980s computer magazines skewed their content towards the hobbyist end of the then microcomputer market , and used to contain type-in program s , but these have gone out of fashion . The first magazine devoted to this class of computers was Creative Computing . Byte was an influential technical journal that published until the 1990s .",

Most computer magazines offer ( or offered ) advice , some offer programming tutorials , reviews of the latest technologies , and advertisements . 1980s computer magazines skewed their content towards the hobbyist end of the then microcomputer market , and used to contain type-in program s , but these have gone out of fashion .

Most computer magazines offer ( or offered ) advice , some offer programming tutorials , reviews of the latest technologies , and advertisements . 1980s computer magazines skewed their content towards the hobbyist end of the then microcomputer market , and used to contain type-in program s , but these have gone out of fashion .

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

Under the treaties , an IGC is called into being by the European Council , and is composed of representatives of the member states , with the Commission , and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating . An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council , at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved , and final political agreement will be reached . A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states , before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification . There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 , especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",

One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs ; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions , unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary ( eg . for minor amendments ) . The European Council of 21\u201322 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC . Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union , as well as the coherence of its external action .",
