The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship .

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship .

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship .

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship .

The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The words were written by Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less-known musical versions exist . The poem bore the subtitle `` '' A magyar n\u00e9p zivataros sz\u00e1zadaib\u00f3l '' '' ( `` From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian nation '' ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle \u2013 by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles \u2013 was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

            "sentence":"It was `` de facto '' used as hymn of the Kingdom of Hungary from its composition in 1844 , and was officially adopted as national anthem of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989 . The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",

The lyrics of `` Himnusz '' are a prayer beginning with the words `` Isten , \u00e1ldd meg a magyart '' . The title in the original manuscript is `` '' Hymnus '' '' \u2014a Latin word meaning `` song of praise '' , and one which is widely used in languages other than English ( eg . French or German ) to mean `` anthem '' . The phonetic transcription `` Himnusz '' replaced the original Latin spelling over time , and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the `` de facto '' anthem of Hungary , so too the word `` himnusz '' took on the meaning `` national anthem '' for other countries as well .",
