His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback .

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

Manutius devoted the later part of his life to publishing and disseminating rare texts . His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

His interest in and preservation of Greek manuscripts mark him as an innovative publisher of his age dedicated to the editions he produced . His `` enchiridia '' , small portable books , revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback . Manutius wanted to produce Greek texts for his readers because he believed that works by Aristotle or Aristophanes in their original Greek form were pure and unadulterated by translation .",

            "sentence":"Before Manutius , publishers rarely printed volumes in Greek , mainly due to the complexity of providing a standardized Greek typeface . Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

            "sentence":"Before Manutius , publishers rarely printed volumes in Greek , mainly due to the complexity of providing a standardized Greek typeface . Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions .

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Manutius published rare manuscripts in their original Greek and Latin forms . He commissioned the creation of typefaces in Greek and Latin resembling humanist handwriting of his time ; typefaces that are the first known precursor of italic type . As the Aldine Press grew in popularity , Manutius 's innovations were quickly copied across Italy despite his efforts to prevent piracy of Aldine editions . Because of the Aldine Press 's growing reputation of meticulous , accurate publications , Erasmus sought out Manutius to publish his translations of `` Iphigenia in Aulis `` .",

Liutprand was born into a prominent family from Pavia , of Lombard origins , around 920 . In 931 he entered service as page to Hugh of Arles , who kept court at Pavia as King of Italy and who married the notorious and powerful Marozia of Rome . Liutprand was educated at the court and became a Deacon at the Cathedral of Pavia . After Hugh died in 947 , leaving his son and co-ruler Lothair on the throne as King of Italy , Liutprand became confidential secretary to the actual ruler of Italy , Berengar II , marchese d'Ivrea , for whom he became chancellor .",

Liutprand was born into a prominent family from Pavia , of Lombard origins , around 920 . In 931 he entered service as page to Hugh of Arles , who kept court at Pavia as King of Italy and who married the notorious and powerful Marozia of Rome . Liutprand was educated at the court and became a Deacon at the Cathedral of Pavia . After Hugh died in 947 , leaving his son and co-ruler Lothair on the throne as King of Italy , Liutprand became confidential secretary to the actual ruler of Italy , Berengar II , marchese d'Ivrea , for whom he became chancellor .",

Liutprand was born into a prominent family from Pavia , of Lombard origins , around 920 . In 931 he entered service as page to Hugh of Arles , who kept court at Pavia as King of Italy and who married the notorious and powerful Marozia of Rome . Liutprand was educated at the court and became a Deacon at the Cathedral of Pavia . After Hugh died in 947 , leaving his son and co-ruler Lothair on the throne as King of Italy , Liutprand became confidential secretary to the actual ruler of Italy , Berengar II , marchese d'Ivrea , for whom he became chancellor .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII 's `` De Administrando Imperio `` . Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",

Both Liutprand 's father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople ( 927 and 942 ) . Liutprand included in his later `` Antapodosis '' ( 950s ) , a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there , including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuch s , and Constantine 's delight in receiving a gift of four `` de luxe '' eunuchs . On his return , however , he fell out with Berengar , for which Liutprand avenged himself in his `` Antapodosis '' ( `` retribution '' ) , and attached himself to Berengar 's rival , the emperor Otto I , who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950 .",
