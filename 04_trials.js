Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",

Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E Howard , H P Lovecraft , Clark Ashton Smith , Edgar Rice Burroughs , JRR Tolkien and Jack Kirby , Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe , with tales told through epic lyrics and music . After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project , Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993 , who were also looking to form a serious band .",
