The lower section spanned the distance between Easton , Pennsylvania and the town of Mauch Chunk , present-day Jim Thorpe , Pennsylvania . In Easton the canal met the Delaware and Morris Canal s , with which goods could be brought further up the east coast . At its height , the Lehigh Canal was long . Although the canal was used to transport a variety of products , its most significant cargoes were anthracite coal and pig iron . Cornerstones of the American Industrial Revolution , they defined the character of the towns surrounding the canal . The route consisted of the canals and dammed-off sections of the Lehigh River . Boatmen had to navigate their barges periodically from the canal through a lock onto the river or vice versa . This design saved time and money while the canal was being built , although it made for a slower , more difficult trip for canal-boat captains . The Lehigh Coal Mine Company ( LCMC ) was founded in 1792 , a few months after anthracite was discovered at Sharpe Mountain ( a peak of the Pisgah Ridge near present-day Summit Hill , Pennsylvania ) ; Its principals secured rights to over before the Lehigh Canal was built .",
