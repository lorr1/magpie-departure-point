An evergreen bamboo native to South America , unlike most species within the genus `` Chusquea `` , it is frost-tolerant and thus widely cultivated in temperate regions . It is native to the Valdivian rainforests , humid temperate forests of Chile and southwestern Argentina . Chusquea culeou is a keystone species which can control patterns of forest dynamics by impeding regeneration of tree species . Growing to tall by broad , `` Chusquea culeou '' forms a substantial clump of greenery .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line .

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

In a solar cooker , for example , food is placed at the focal line of a trough , which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry . For other purposes , a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line . The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight . The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine , which uses the heat energy to drive machinery , or to generate electricity .",

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie .

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie . ( Electrical Output Power ) \/ ( Total Impinging Solar Power ) is about 15 % , similar to PV ( Photovoltaic Cells ) but less than Stirling dish concentrators .

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie .

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie . ( Electrical Output Power ) \/ ( Total Impinging Solar Power ) is about 15 % , similar to PV ( Photovoltaic Cells ) but less than Stirling dish concentrators .

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie . ( Electrical Output Power ) \/ ( Total Impinging Solar Power ) is about 15 % , similar to PV ( Photovoltaic Cells ) but less than Stirling dish concentrators . Large-scale solar thermal power plants need a method for storing the energy , such as a thermocline tank , which uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank .",

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator , thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80 % . The overall efficiency from collector to grid , ie . ( Electrical Output Power ) \/ ( Total Impinging Solar Power ) is about 15 % , similar to PV ( Photovoltaic Cells ) but less than Stirling dish concentrators . Large-scale solar thermal power plants need a method for storing the energy , such as a thermocline tank , which uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' .

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' .

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' .

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' . A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .",

However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server , and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence . Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a `` PlayStation World '' network . In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named `` PlayStation Network Platform '' .
