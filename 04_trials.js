Any revisions to the Charter or Byelaws require the approval of the Privy Council . The design of the Institute 's Mycenae an lions medal and the Latin motto `` Usui civium , decori urbium '' has been attributed to Thomas Leverton Donaldson , who had been honorary secretary until 1839 .",

Any revisions to the Charter or Byelaws require the approval of the Privy Council .
