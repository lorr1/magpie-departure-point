This is a list of rulers of Wallachia , from the first mention of a medieval polity situated between the Southern Carpathians and the Danube until the union with Moldavia in 1859 , leading to the creation of Romania . Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

This is a list of rulers of Wallachia , from the first mention of a medieval polity situated between the Southern Carpathians and the Danube until the union with Moldavia in 1859 , leading to the creation of Romania . Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

            "sentence":"Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

            "sentence":"Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

            "sentence":"Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

            "sentence":"Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

            "sentence":"Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe , given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family ( on principle , princes were chosen from any family branch , including a previous ruler 's bastard sons , being defined as `` os de domn '' , `` of Voivode marrow '' , or as having `` heregie '' , `` heredity `` ( from the Latin `` hereditas '' ) ; the institutions charged with the election , dominated by the boyars , had fluctuating degrees of influence ) . The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice .

The system itself was challenged by usurper s , and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch , when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans ; between 1821 and 1878 ( the date of Romania 's independence ) , various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice . Wallachian rulers , like the Moldavian rulers , bore the titles of `` Voivode '' ( `` duke '' ) or\/and Hospodar ( `` lord , master '' ) ; when writing in Romanian , the term Domn ( from the Latin `` dominus `` ) was used .",
