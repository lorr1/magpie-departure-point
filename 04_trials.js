The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .",

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .",

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system .

The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on `` Serenity '' . Whedon pitched the show as `` nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things '' . The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .",

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . According to Whedon 's vision , `` nothing will change in the future : technology will advance , but we will still have the same political , moral , and ethical problems as today '' . `` Firefly '' premiered in the US on the Fox network on September 20 , 2002 .",

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . According to Whedon 's vision , `` nothing will change in the future : technology will advance , but we will still have the same political , moral , and ethical problems as today '' . `` Firefly '' premiered in the US on the Fox network on September 20 , 2002 .",

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . According to Whedon 's vision , `` nothing will change in the future : technology will advance , but we will still have the same political , moral , and ethical problems as today '' . `` Firefly '' premiered in the US on the Fox network on September 20 , 2002 .",

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . According to Whedon 's vision , `` nothing will change in the future : technology will advance , but we will still have the same political , moral , and ethical problems as today '' . `` Firefly '' premiered in the US on the Fox network on September 20 , 2002 .",

The show explores the lives of a group of people , some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war , who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system . In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . According to Whedon 's vision , `` nothing will change in the future : technology will advance , but we will still have the same political , moral , and ethical problems as today '' . `` Firefly '' premiered in the US on the Fox network on September 20 , 2002 .",

In this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the United States and China , fused to form the central federal government , called the Alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures .
