The magazine debuted on February 16 , 1990 , in New York City . Different from celebrity-focused publications such as `` Us Weekly `` , `` People `` ( a sister magazine to `` EW '' ) , and `` In Touch Weekly `` , `` EW '' primarily concentrates on entertainment media news and critical reviews . However , unlike `` Variety `` and `` The Hollywood Reporter `` , which are aimed at industry insiders , `` EW '' targets a more general audience . Formed as a sister magazine to `` People '' , the first issue of `` Entertainment Weekly '' was published on February 16 , 1990 .",

Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year , he was also a champion at ages two , three , and four . In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 US Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth . Joe Hirsch of the `` Daily Racing Form '' wrote of his three-year-old campaign : `` Every time he ran he was an odds-on favorite , and the response to his presence on the racetrack , either for a morning workout or a major race , was electric .

Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year , he was also a champion at ages two , three , and four . In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 US Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth . Joe Hirsch of the `` Daily Racing Form '' wrote of his three-year-old campaign : `` Every time he ran he was an odds-on favorite , and the response to his presence on the racetrack , either for a morning workout or a major race , was electric . 'Slewmania ' was a virulent and widespread condition '' .",

In `` distributed computing '' , a problem is divided into many tasks , each of which is solved by one or more computers , which communicate with each other via message passing . The word `` distributed '' in terms such as `` distributed system '' , `` distributed programming '' , and `` distributed algorithm `` originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area .

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In January 2007 UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada 's national tent pegging team . The team was officially re-flagged as `` UNICEF Team Canada '' , and its riders wear UNICEF 's logo in competition , and team members promote and raise funds for UNICEF 's campaign against childhood HIV-AIDS . When the team became the 2008 tent pegging world champions , UNICEF 's flag was raised alongside the Canadian flag at the games , the first time in the history of international Grand Prix equestrian competition that a non-state flag has flown over the medal podium .",

UNICEF works directly with companies to improve their business practices , bringing them in line with obligations under international law , and ensuring that they respect children 's rights in the realms of the marketplace , workplace , and the community . In 2012 , UNICEF worked with Save the Children and The United Nations Global Compact to develop the Children 's Rights and Business Principles and now these guidelines form the basis UNICEF 's advice to companies . UNICEF works with companies seeking to improve their social sustainability by guiding them through a due diligence process where issues throughout their supply chain , such as child labor , can be identified and actions to ratify them are put in place . The Girl Star project is a series of films which documents stories of girls from the most disadvantaged communities across five northern states in India who , through via education , have managed to break socio-economic constraints to make a success of their lives and become self-sufficient .",

UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale , permanent orphanages for children , preferring instead to find children places in their ( extended ) families and communities , wherever possible . This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries ; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents . A 2015 article in `` US News & World Report `` magazine asserted UNICEF 's intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place , and have even labeled UNICEF a `` villain '' for the extent of its negative impact on orphans . Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context , encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child-centric viewpoint .",
