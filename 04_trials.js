                "sentence":"Entertainment Weekly ( sometimes abbreviated as EW ) is an American monthly entertainment magazine based in New York City , published by Meredith Corporation , that covers film , television , music , Broadway theatre , books , and popular culture . The magazine debuted on February 16 , 1990 , in New York City . Different from celebrity-focused publications such as `` Us Weekly `` , `` People `` ( a sister magazine to `` EW '' ) , and `` In Touch Weekly `` , `` EW '' primarily concentrates on entertainment media news and critical reviews . However , unlike `` Variety `` and `` The Hollywood Reporter `` , which are aimed at industry insiders , `` EW '' targets a more general audience . Formed as a sister magazine to `` People '' , the first issue of `` Entertainment Weekly '' was published on February 16 , 1990 .",

The magazine debuted on February 16 , 1990 , in New York City . Different from celebrity-focused publications such as `` Us Weekly `` , `` People `` ( a sister magazine to `` EW '' ) , and `` In Touch Weekly `` , `` EW '' primarily concentrates on entertainment media news and critical reviews .

Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year , he was also a champion at ages two , three , and four . In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 US Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth . Joe Hirsch of the `` Daily Racing Form '' wrote of his three-year-old campaign : `` Every time he ran he was an odds-on favorite , and the response to his presence on the racetrack , either for a morning workout or a major race , was electric . 'Slewmania ' was a virulent and widespread condition '' .",

Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year , he was also a champion at ages two , three , and four . In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 US Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth . Joe Hirsch of the `` Daily Racing Form '' wrote of his three-year-old campaign : `` Every time he ran he was an odds-on favorite , and the response to his presence on the racetrack , either for a morning workout or a major race , was electric . 'Slewmania ' was a virulent and widespread condition '' .",
