Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt .

He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt .

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt . Scholl 's early operatic roles include his standing in for Ren\u00e9 Jacobs in 1993 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Gr\u00e9vin in Paris , where he caused a sensation .",

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt . Scholl 's early operatic roles include his standing in for Ren\u00e9 Jacobs in 1993 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Gr\u00e9vin in Paris , where he caused a sensation .",

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt .

He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt .

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt . Scholl 's early operatic roles include his standing in for Ren\u00e9 Jacobs in 1993 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Gr\u00e9vin in Paris , where he caused a sensation .",

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt . Scholl 's early operatic roles include his standing in for Ren\u00e9 Jacobs in 1993 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Gr\u00e9vin in Paris , where he caused a sensation .",

Aged 13 , he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981 . Just four years later , Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students , based on the strength and quality of his voice . He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis , succeeding his own teacher , Richard Levitt .

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

                "sentence":"Labour Day weekend , roughly 12 or 13 weeks into the CFL season , is known for its matchups that do not change from year to year , unlike other `` rivalry '' weeks of the CFL schedule . Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

                "sentence":"Labour Day weekend , roughly 12 or 13 weeks into the CFL season , is known for its matchups that do not change from year to year , unlike other `` rivalry '' weeks of the CFL schedule . Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks ( the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other ) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday . Mark 's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014 . The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts , while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders . The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday , but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019 , the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

In the United States , Nepal and some other countries , UNICEF is known for its `` Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF '' program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night , sometimes instead of candy . UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world , but not involved in nine others ( Bahamas , Brunei , Cyprus , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Malta , Mauritius , Monaco , Singapore , and Taiwan ) . Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF 's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF . These non-governmental organization s ( NGO ) are primarily responsible for fundraising , selling UNICEF greeting cards and products , creating private and public partnerships , advocating for children 's rights , and providing other support .",

UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale , permanent orphanages for children , preferring instead to find children places in their ( extended ) families and communities , wherever possible . This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries ; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents . A 2015 article in `` US News & World Report `` magazine asserted UNICEF 's intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place , and have even labeled UNICEF a `` villain '' for the extent of its negative impact on orphans . Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context , encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child-centric viewpoint .",
