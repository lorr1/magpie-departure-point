Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are : concurrency of components , lack of a global clock , and independent failure of components . Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online game s to peer-to-peer applications . A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program ( and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs ) . There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism , including pure HTTP , RPC-like connectors and message queues . `` Distributed computing '' also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems . In `` distributed computing '' , a problem is divided into many tasks , each of which is solved by one or more computers , which communicate with each other via message passing . The word `` distributed '' in terms such as `` distributed system '' , `` distributed programming '' , and `` distributed algorithm `` originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area . The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense , even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing . While there is no single definition of a distributed system , the following defining properties are commonly used as : A distributed system may have a common goal , such as solving a large computational problem ; the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit .",

Rajchman is to this day the only person who served as UNICEF 's Chairman for longer than 2 years . On Rajchman 's suggestion , the American Maurice Pate was appointed first executive director , serving from 1947 until his death in 1965 . In 1950 , UNICEF 's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women in developing countries everywhere . In 1953 , it became a permanent part of the United Nations System , and the words `` international '' and `` emergency '' were dropped from the organization 's name , though it retained the original acronym , `` UNICEF '' . UNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors . UNICEF 's total income for 2015 was US $ 5,009,557,471 . Governments contribute two-thirds of the organization 's resources . It is estimated that 92 percent of UNICEF revenue is distributed to program services . UNICEF 's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children .",
